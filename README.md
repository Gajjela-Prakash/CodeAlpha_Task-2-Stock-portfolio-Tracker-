A simple stock tracker application built during my **Python Programming Internship at CodeAlpha**. It calculates total investment value based on hardcoded stock prices and user input.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Dictionaries
- User input/output
- File writing (`portfolio_summary.txt`)

## ▶️ How It Works
- User enters stock symbols (AAPL, TSLA, etc.)
- User enters number of shares
- Total investment is calculated
- Portfolio is optionally saved to a `.txt` file
